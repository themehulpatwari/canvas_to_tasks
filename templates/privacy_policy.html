            <p>This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is collected, used, and shared when you use our Canvas to Google Tasks Sync application.</p>
            
            <h2>What Information We Collect</h2>
            <p>When you use our application, we collect the following information:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Account Information:</strong> When you log in with your Google account, we receive your email address, name, and profile picture as provided by Google.</li>
                <li><strong>Calendar Data:</strong> We access the calendar events from the Canvas ICS URL you provide to convert them into tasks.</li>
                <li><strong>OAuth Tokens:</strong> We store OAuth tokens provided by Google to maintain your authenticated session and sync your tasks automatically.</li>
                <li><strong>Calendar URLs:</strong> We store the Canvas ICS calendar URLs you provide to enable automatic syncing.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
            <p>We use the information we collect to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Authenticate you with Google's services</li>
                <li>Create and manage tasks in your Google Tasks based on your calendar events</li>
                <li>Enable automatic background syncing of your calendar events to Google Tasks</li>
                <li>Improve and optimize the application's functionality</li>
                <li>Communicate with you about the service if necessary</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>
            <p>We store your information in a secure MongoDB database. We implement appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction of your personal information. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure, so we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>
            
            <h2>Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
            <p><strong>We do not share, transfer, or disclose Google user data to any third parties.</strong> We do not store your task information - we only store your Google OAuth refresh token to maintain authentication for the service. This token allows us to create and manage tasks in your Google Tasks account based on your Canvas calendar events when you use our application. We do not sell, rent, or lease your personal information to third parties.</p>
            
            <p>The only exceptions where disclosure might occur are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>With Your Consent:</strong> We will share your personal information with third parties only when we have your explicit consent to do so.</li>
                <li><strong>For Legal Reasons:</strong> We may share information if we have a good-faith belief that access, use, preservation, or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to comply with applicable laws, regulations, legal processes, or enforceable governmental requests.</li>
                <li><strong>Service Providers:</strong> We may share limited information with trusted service providers who help us operate our application, such as hosting providers. These providers are bound by contractual obligations to keep personal information confidential and use it only for the purposes for which we disclose it to them.</li>
                <li><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, we will continue to ensure the confidentiality of your personal information and give affected users notice before personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
            <p>Our application integrates with the following third-party services:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Google OAuth and Google Tasks API:</strong> We use these services to authenticate you and to create tasks in your Google account. Your use of Google services is subject to Google's Privacy Policy.</li>
                <li><strong>MongoDB Atlas:</strong> We use MongoDB Atlas to store your information securely. MongoDB's use of your data is subject to their Privacy Policy.</li>
            </ul>
